# Hello! ðŸ¦‰  I'm Jacob, a ***game composer*** turned ***product designer*** turned ***software developer***, currently living in Silicon Valley.

#### With a focus on front-end development and a mixed bag of experience in other areas of tech, I enjoy using code as a creative tool to bring ideas to life.

#### Passionately curious, I'm always doing my best to learn and grow, and enjoy spending my free time skill building in many other areas including: language studies (currently studying Mandarin and Korean), 3D art/design, photography, creating YouTube videos, and learning to play the violin and cello.
